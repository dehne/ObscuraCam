      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        Ah, yes, T's and C's. Even fun stuff has to have them, it seems. We'll try to keep things short. And understandable.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        People can use ObscuraCam to take photos when Port Townsend's Mobile Camera Obscura is in use at an event. It's not 
        reasonable to expect privacy at such events.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a person connects their device to ObscuraCam's WiFi, visits its built in website and then clicks a button, 
        ObscuraCam takes a photo of the screen inside the camera obscura. After it does so it sends the photo to the connected 
        device for the person to see and, if they desire, to save. It also keeps a copy of the photo for The Raw Art 
        Collective and others to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Raw Art Collective doesn't sell the photos ObscuraCam takes to advertisers or data brokers, but it also doesn't 
        take measures to protect the photos from public viewing or reuse. You should assume that photos you or others take with 
        ObscuraCam are likely find their way into the public view.
      </p>
      <h2>Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        By using ObscuraCam you agree to assign the copyright for photos you take with it to The Raw Art Collective. That means 
        all photos you take with ObscuraCam are copyright by The Raw Art Collective. The Raw Art Collective licenses all photos 
        taken with ObscuraCam for public use under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License. 
        (See &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.en&gt; for the full license.) Through this license any 
        ObscuraCam photo can be adapted and used for a wide range of purposes, including some you may not like.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't agree with these Terms and Conditions, don't use ObscuraCam.
